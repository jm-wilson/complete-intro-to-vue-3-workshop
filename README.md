> Hi! This repo contains all of my code as I work through the [Complete Intro to Vue 3 Workshop](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vue-fundamentals) course on Frontend Masters.  Each batch of changes is loosely aligned with one of the course's exercises, but these changes are not identical to the course's content.

> My approach to learning often involves following various rabbit holes when I want to understand something better, and cutting other corners when I think I understand them well enough.  While my code in this repo is public for all to see, I would recommend taking the course on Frontend Masters and finding your own rabbit holes to follow (and corners to cut!) to suit your own learning journey.
